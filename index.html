                    <h5>February 2022 to Present</h5>
                    <p>I am currently a <span class="fw-bold">Lead Controls Engineer</span>. I lead a team that is responsible for developing a common LabVIEW framework that will be used by other developers to create components in a large (100+) distributed system. I spend most of my time developing in LabVIEW, but I've also been integrating HTML/CSS/JavaScript with LabVIEW and our CI/CD process to simplify code building and deployment across the team.</p>
                    <h5>February 2018 to February 2022</h5>
                    <p>I started working as a <span class="fw-bold">Senior Controls Engineer</span>. I was responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining individual control and diagnostic systems that were a part of a large (50+) distributed system. I worked alongside different scientists and physicians to provide science-driven control systems.</p>

                    <p>I began my work as <span class="fw-bold">Project Engineer</span> working on small LabVIEW modules. After gaining experience, I was promoted to <span class="fw-bold">Lead Software Engineer</span> and became responsible for larger LabVIEW projects. Here I was able to develop the software for different metrology instruments that were designed to take precise, non-contact measurements.</p>
